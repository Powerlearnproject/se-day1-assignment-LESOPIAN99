# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of designing developing testing and maintenance of software. 
important 
is creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of Mordenlife including communication and healthcare 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
development of programming language eg Fortran c,the establishment of software engineering as a discipline,the advert of structured programming 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: gathering documenting user needs and system requirements 
design creating high level and detailed design of software 
implementation writing code and building the software according to design 
testing conducting various test to ensure the software meets quality standards 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is rigid and best for projects with clear, unchanging requirements.
Agile is flexible and ideal for projects where needs might evolve.
Examples waterfall: a scenario where building a house where each step must be done in order while Agile is where developing an app where features are added for adjust base on user feedback during development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: writing, testing and maintaining the code that makes up the software product 
responsibility:
Coding, debugging, collaboration documention

Quality assurance engineer: ensuring software is of high quality before release 
Responsibility 
testing, verification, reporting, collaboration 

Project manager: overseas the entire project to completion 
Responsibility 
planning, coordination,risk management, monitoring 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
important of IDES
efficiency 
productivity
debugging 
integration 
examples 
visual studio code, intellij IDEA, eclipse 

important of vcs
collaboration 
tracking changes 
backups and recovery 
branching and merging 
examples 
git, subversion, mercurial 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines 
Technical debt 
Changing requirement
Strategies are as follows 
effective communication 
prioritization of task
regular reassessment of project 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: testing components module of software 
integration testing: testing interaction between components and subsystem 
system testing: testing the entire software system 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
is the crafting questions or statement to get best possible response from AI model.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example what is software engineering 
give a definite of software engineering be brief and specific
